Time Series Analysis of Accelerometer Sensor Data

• Analyzed 3-dimenisonal accelerometer data of users to identify their activity using horizontal and natural visibility graphs
• Observed the relation between permutation entropy and complexity of each sensor for all 3-dimensions by changing delay values
and selected the best sensor location for each activity
